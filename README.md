Nano is a .NET Core 2.0+ library.  
It combines common patterns and practices, and allows developers to build and deploy REST micro-services, rapidly.  

The library is easily consumed and configured. Inject provider dependencies for logging, data context and eventing. Derive concrete class implementations for Application, Service, Controller, Model and so on, from enriched default abstractions and interfaces. Stay focused on the objective of modelling the business domain (models and operations), and prevent wasting development resources on non-business related functionality.  

The project is inspired by years of tedious repeatitions, contunously re-writing similar code-snippets and libraries, to handle common functionality not directly related 
to any specific business domain, but to infrastructure, hosting, configuration, logging, data, versioning, repositories, valiation and more.
